summary: "Remove minimum core limit (Standardiser) from pool factory"
description: |
  Currently the ``create_composite_pool`` function applies a COBalD ``Standardiser`` to ensure the at least one drone is
  requested. This overwrites all Standardisers using the minimum parameter in the COBalD pipeline. It turns out that
  the ``Standardiser`` is not needed anymore, since the ``utilisation`` and ``allocation`` is always 1.0 when no drone
  is running, so that automatically one is requested.
version: 0.7.0
