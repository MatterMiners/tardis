summary: Adjust ElasticSearch plugin to support client versions >=7.17,<8.0.0
description: |
  The latest versions of the Elasticsearch client have a compatibility mode which can also be used for newer server 
  versions. Includes also a fix for the case where `resource_status` is not part of `resource_attributes`, which 
  occasionally caused crashes. Newer versions of the Elasticsearch client require the `scheme` parameter to be set. 
  By setting this already, it will be easier to eventually transition to client version 8.
