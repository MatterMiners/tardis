summary: "Adjust ElasticSearch plugin to support client versions >=7.17,<8.0.0"
description: "The latest versions of the Elasticsearch client have a compatibility\
  \ mode which can also be used for newer server \nversions. Includes also a fix for\
  \ the case where `resource_status` is not part of `resource_attributes`, which \n\
  occasionally caused crashes. Newer versions of the Elasticsearch client require\
  \ the `scheme` parameter to be set. \nBy setting this already, it will be easier\
  \ to eventually transition to client version 8.\n"
