summary: "Fixed state transition for stopped workers"
description: "Fixes an unexpected behaviour for Drones in AvailableState in case the\
  \ HTCondor daemon on nodes is shutdown\nautomatically causing the machine status\
  \ to be NotAvailable, while the resource status continues to be Running. In \nthat\
  \ case the drone state is re-set to IntegratingState. Since HTCondor is not restarted,\
  \ the Drone remains in this \nstate forever.\n"
