  Fixes an unexpected behaviour for Drones in AvailableState in case the HTCondor daemon on nodes is shutdown
  automatically causing the machine status to be NotAvailable, while the resource status continues to be Running. In 
  that case the drone state is re-set to IntegratingState. Since HTCondor is not restarted, the Drone remains in this 
  state forever.
