summary: "Improved the handling of SSH connection losses"
description: |
  Improved SSH resilience via configurable retries for connection-related command failures and the implementation of an 
  exponential backoff strategy. This transition from linear to exponential delays ensures more responsive initial 
  recovery attempts while maintaining a comparable overall maximum timeout.
