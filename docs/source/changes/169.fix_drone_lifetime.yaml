summary: "Fixes a bug that the drone_minimum_lifetime parameter is not working as\
  \ described in the documentation"
description: |
  The `drone_minimum_lifetime` parameter is not working as expected and described in the documentation.
  `drone_minimum_lifetime` is meant to be a generic site parameter. However the code is trying to look it up in the
  site adapter specific section of the configuration. Since default values are applied if the parameter is not
  present, it remains probably unnoted by users.
