summary: "Handle littered status feedback in csv_parser"
description: |
  In rare cases it can happen, that a `squeue` call is returning not only the
  desired status csv of jobs in the batch system, but some additional messages
  like `Switch to work directory on corresponding scratch directory.` The 
  `csv_parser` has been modified to ignore such additional messages while 
  parsing the csv.
