summary: "Handle littered status feedback in csv_parser"
description: "In rare cases it can happen, that a `squeue` call is returning not only\
  \ the\ndesired status csv of jobs in the batch system, but some additional messages\n\
  like `Switch to work directory on corresponding scratch directory.` The \n`csv_parser`\
  \ has been modified to ignore such additional messages while \nparsing the csv.\n"
