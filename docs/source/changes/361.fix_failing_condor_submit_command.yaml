summary: "Fix failing condor_suspend on not running resources"
description: |
  In case a job is not running (anymore) and a `condor_suspend` command is issued it fails with exit code 1 and prints 
  the following message 'Job 15611.0 not running to be suspended'. This is now correctly handled and does lead to crash 
  of TARDIS.
