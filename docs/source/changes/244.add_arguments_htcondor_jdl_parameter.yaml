summary: "Add support for passing environment variables as executable arguments to\
  \ support HTCondor grid universe"
description: "In order to properly identify started drones in the overlay batch system\
  \ and to limit the amount of resources \n(CPU cores, memory, disk) announced to\
  \ be available, a set of environment variables needs to be set inside the drone.\
  \ \nIn case of the HTCondor grid universe such an environment is usually dropped\
  \ by the Grid Compute Element. Therefore \nthe possibility to pass the environment\
  \ variables using executable arguments has been added.\n"
