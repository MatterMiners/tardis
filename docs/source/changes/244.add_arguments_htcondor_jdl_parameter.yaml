summary: "Add support for passing environment variables as executable arguments to support HTCondor grid universe"
description: |
  In order to properly identify started drones in the overlay batch system and to limit the amount of resources 
  (CPU cores, memory, disk) announced to be available, a set of environment variables needs to be set inside the drone. 
  In case of the HTCondor grid universe such an environment is usually dropped by the Grid Compute Element. Therefore 
  the possibility to pass the environment variables using executable arguments has been added.
