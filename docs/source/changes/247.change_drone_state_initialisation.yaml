summary: "Change drone state initialisation and notification of plugins"
description: |
  The initialisation procedure and the notification of the plugins is
  changed to fix a bug occurring on restarts of Drones. A newly created Drone
  is now initialised with ``state = None`` and all plugins are notified first
  state change ``None`` -> ``RequestState``. The Drone is now inserted in the
  `SqliteRegistry` when it state changes to ``RequestState`` and all
  subsequent changes are DB updates. So, failing duplicated inserts due to the
  unique requirement of the  ``drone_uuid`` are prevented in case a Drone
  changes back to ``BootingState`` again.
version: 0.7.0
