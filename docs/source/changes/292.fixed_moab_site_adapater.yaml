summary: "Disable change of drone_uuid after resource deployment in Moab adapter"
description: |
  The Moab site adapter is changing the drone_uuid after the resource has been deployed to name-<moab_job_id>. Due to
  this the SqliteRegistry is not updated anymore (since #247 ), so that TARDIS forgets about deployed resources in case
  of a restart of the service. This pull requests removes that feature from the Moab adapter and deploys the standard
  TardisDrone environments variables in the job environment instead, so that the drone can take care of setting the
  right attributes to the OBS, so that TARDIS can associate drones to running jobs.
