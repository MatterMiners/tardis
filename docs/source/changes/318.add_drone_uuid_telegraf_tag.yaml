summary: "Add drone_uuid tag to the telegraf record"
description: "So far, the telegraf plugin sends only state changes of the drones to\
  \ telegraf, however it does not include \nthe `drone_uuid`, so that the information\
  \ cannot be associated to a specific drone. Now, the `drone_uuid` is added as \n\
  a tag to the record send to telegraf.\n"
