summary: "Add drone_uuid tag to the telegraf record"
description: |
  So far, the telegraf plugin sends only state changes of the drones to telegraf, however it does not include 
  the `drone_uuid`, so that the information cannot be associated to a specific drone. Now, the `drone_uuid` is added as 
  a tag to the record send to telegraf.
