summary: "Fix state transitions for jobs retried by HTCondor"
description: |
  In case a job is in `DrainingState`, `ShuttingDownState` or `ShutDownState` a transition back to BootingState is
  currently not covered by `TARDIS`. However, a currently running job can potentially be retried by HTCondor in case of
  an internal error. Now, retried jobs previously in `DrainingState`, `ShuttingDownState` or `ShutDownState` are removed
  entirely from the batch queue.
