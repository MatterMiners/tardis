summary: "Add new duping SSH executor to support HPC ssh command keys"
description: |
  The new duping ssh executor is a special solution for High Performance Compute Centers, which offer the opportunity to
  register so called ssh command keys (ssh key that can access the cluster without multi-factor authentication, but that
  is restricted to execute one single command without any additional command line arguments). The duping ssh executor
  executes commands passed over via standard input to a wrapper script, that takes care of the actual execution.
