  `TARDIS` supports running more than one Drone on the same host. To differentiate the drones, the `TardisDroneUuid` has
  been introduced and will be set as `STARTD_NAME` on the corresponding sites. `TARDIS` used to use only the `hostname`
  when draining resources. This change will take into account the provided `STARTD_NAME` as well.
