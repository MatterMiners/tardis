summary: "Introduced Bulk Executor and HTCondor Bulk Operations"
description: "Introduced bulk execution to HTCondor SiteAdapter including generic\
  \ AsyncBulkCall framework class for collecting \ntasks to execute in bulk. HTCondorAdapter\
  \ uses bulk executions for its commands `deploy resource`, `stop resource` and\n\
  `terminate resource`. Changes the Resource UUID format used by the HTCondor Site\
  \ adapter to `ClusterId.ProcId`.\n"
