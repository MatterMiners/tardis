summary: "Introduced Bulk Executor and HTCondor Bulk Operations"
description: |
  Introduced bulk execution to HTCondor SiteAdapter including generic AsyncBulkCall framework class for collecting 
  tasks to execute in bulk. HTCondorAdapter uses bulk executions for its commands `deploy resource`, `stop resource` and
  `terminate resource`. Changes the Resource UUID format used by the HTCondor Site adapter to `ClusterId.ProcId`.
