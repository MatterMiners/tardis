summary: "Fix state transitions and refactoring of the SLURM site adapter"
description: |
  The SLURM site adapter contains now state transition for all possible job states in the SLURM batch system. For some
  states the transition to `TARDIS` `resources_states` has been corrected leading to an infinite execution of `scancel`
  to jobs not in the queue anymore. In addtion, `squeue` (jobs in batch queue) instead of the `sacct`
  (Accounting tool listing also history of jobs) is used in order to minize the number of jobs to keep track of.
