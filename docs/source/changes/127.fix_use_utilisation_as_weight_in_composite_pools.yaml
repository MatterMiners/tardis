summary: "Use utilisation as weight in composite pools"
description: |
  The experience of using `WeightedComposite` pools in production shows that weighting the `demand` of resources by
  their `supply` is not always the best choice. Weighting the `demand` of resources by `utilisation` is instead more
  desired, since `COBalD` should increase the best utilised resource.
