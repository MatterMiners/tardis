summary: "Fix utilization of updated timestamp and potential ignoring of drone minimum lifetime"
description: |
  The original idea was that created and updated timestamps indicate a change 
  of the `DroneState`. However, in the meantime it was also updated in some 
  SiteAdapters, when the resource status changed, e.g. through a 
  `resource_status` call on certain SiteAdapters. Through the 
  `drone_minimum_lifetime` setting seems to be ignored, because `resource_status` 
  is called every minute, while `drone_minimum_lifetime` is usually in the order of hours.
