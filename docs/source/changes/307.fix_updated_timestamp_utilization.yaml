summary: "Fix utilization of updated timestamp and potential ignoring of drone minimum\
  \ lifetime"
description: "The original idea was that created and updated timestamps indicate a\
  \ change \nof the `DroneState`. However, in the meantime it was also updated in\
  \ some \nSiteAdapters, when the resource status changed, e.g. through a \n`resource_status`\
  \ call on certain SiteAdapters. Through the \n`drone_minimum_lifetime` setting seems\
  \ to be ignored, because `resource_status` \nis called every minute, while `drone_minimum_lifetime`\
  \ is usually in the order of hours.\n"
