summary: "Fixing recurrent cancellation of jobs TIMEOUTED in Slurm"
description: |
  Fixed a problem where Slurm jobs in status TIMEOUT are not handled correctly.
  Slurm TIMEOUT state were handled as `ResourceStatus.Error` causing TARDIS to
  repeatedly cleanup the job from the batch system using `scancel`. Now timeouted
  drones in Slurm are handled as `ResourceStatus.Deleted` instead.
