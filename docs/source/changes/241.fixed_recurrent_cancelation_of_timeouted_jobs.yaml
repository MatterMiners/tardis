summary: "Fixing recurrent cancellation of jobs TIMEOUTED in Slurm"
description: "Fixed a problem where Slurm jobs in status TIMEOUT are not handled correctly.\
  \ Slurm TIMEOUT state were handled as \n`ResourceStatus.Error` causing TARDIS to\
  \ repeatedly cleanup the job from the batch system using `scancel`. Now \ntimeouted\
  \ drones in Slurm are handled as `ResourceStatus.Deleted` instead.\n"
