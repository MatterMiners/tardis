summary: "Add status and terminate command line options to SLURM adapter"
description: |
  Depending on the setup of the SLURM clusters, some might need to also add specific command line options to the 
  `squeue` and `scancel` in order to work correctly. For example: `squeue -M cm4 -p cm4_tiny`. Therefore, a general
  approach has been implemented to allow for using arbitary command line options for the status update and termination 
  of jobs.
