summary: "Add status and terminate command line options to SLURM adapter"
description: "Depending on the setup of the SLURM clusters, some might need to also\
  \ add specific command line options to the \n`squeue` and `scancel` in order to\
  \ work correctly. For example: `squeue -M cm4 -p cm4_tiny`. Therefore, a general\n\
  approach has been implemented to allow for using arbitary command line options for\
  \ the status update and termination \nof jobs.\n"
