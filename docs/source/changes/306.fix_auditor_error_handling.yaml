summary: "Fix auditor error handling when updating non-existing record"
description: |
  It can happen that a drone is submitted but never reaches the AvailableState, since demand for resources is decreasing
  and the drone is cleaned-up before and it reaches DownState. This case is currently not handled correctly in the 
  auditor plugin, since it tries to update a non-existing record.
