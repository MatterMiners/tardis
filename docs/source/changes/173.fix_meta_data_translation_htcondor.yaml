summary: "Fixes a bug in the HTCondor Site Adapter which leads to wrong requirements when using non HTCondor OBS"
description: |
  The HTCondor Site Adapter takes a wrong `machine_meta_data_translation_mapping` into account in some circumstances.
  Due to a bug introduced in #157, the HTCondor Site Adapter uses the `machine_meta_data_translation_mapping` of the
  Batchsystem Adapter (OBS). In case the OBS is also HTCondor or the OBS has the same translations it does not have any
  affect. However, in case the OBS is using different units for memory and disk space --hence different translation
  mappings-- the requested Drones have wrong requirements.
