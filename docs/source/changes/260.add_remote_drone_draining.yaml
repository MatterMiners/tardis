summary: "Added support for manual draining of drones using the REST API"
description: "Added limited support to synchronize the state stored in the ``SqliteRegistry``\
  \ with the current state of the drone. \nOnly implemented for drones in ``AvailableState``\
  \ which can transition to ``DrainState`` via a remote update of the \n``SqliteRegistry``,\
  \ i.e. using the REST API.\n"
