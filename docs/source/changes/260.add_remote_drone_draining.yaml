summary: "Added support for manual draining of drones using the REST API"
description: |
  Added limited support to synchronise the state stored in the ``SqliteRegistry`` with the current state of the drone. 
  Only implemented for drones in ``AvailableState`` which can transition to ``DrainState`` via a remote update of the 
  ``SqliteRegistry`` i.e. using the REST API.
