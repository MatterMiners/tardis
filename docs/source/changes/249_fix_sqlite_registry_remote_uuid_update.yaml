summary: "Update the remote_resource_uuid in sqlite registry on a each update"
description: |
  The change drone state initialisation update revealed a bug in TARDIS. The ``remote_resource_uuid`` in the 
  ``SqliteRegistry`` plugin in not updated at all. As a result, TARDIS keeps crashing on restarts due to the missing 
  ``remote_resource_uuid`` until the DB has been removed.
