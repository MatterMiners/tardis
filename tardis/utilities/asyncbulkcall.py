    Protocol of callables suitable for :py:class:`~.BulkExecution`

    A bulk command must take an arbitrary number of tasks and is expected to provide
    an iterable of one result per task. Alternatively, it may provide a single
    :py:data:`None` value to indicate that there is no result. An unhandled
    :py:class:`Exception` means that all tasks failed with that :py:class:`Exception`.

class AsyncBulkCall(Generic[T, R]):
    """
    Framework for queueing and executing several tasks via bulk commands

    :param command: async callable that executes several tasks
    :param size: maximum number of tasks to execute in one bulk
    :param delay: maximum time window for tasks to execute in one bulk
    :param concurrent: how often the `command` may be executed at the same time

    Given some bulk-task callable ``(T, ...) -> (R, ...)`` (the ``command``),
    :py:class:`~.BulkExecution` represents a single-task callable ``(T) -> R``.
    Single-task calls are buffered for a moment according to ``size`` and ``delay``,
    then executed in bulk with ``concurrent`` calls to ``command``.

    Each :py:class:`~.BulkExecution` should represent a different ``command``
    (for example, ``rm`` or ``mkdir``) collecting similar tasks (for example,
    ``rm foo`` and ``rm bar`` to ``rm foo bar``). The ``command`` is an arbitrary
    async callable and can freely decide how to handle its tasks. The
    :py:class:`~.BulkExecution` takes care of collecting individual tasks,
    partitioning them to bulks, and translating the results of bulk execution
    back to individual tasks.

    Both ``size`` and ``delay`` control how long to queue tasks at most
    before starting to execute them. The ``concurrent`` parameter controls
    how many bulks may run at once; when concurrency is low tasks
    may be waiting for execution even past ``size`` and ``delay``.
    Possible values for ``concurrent`` are :py:data:`None` for unlimited concurrency
    or an integer above 0 to set a precise concurrency limit.

    .. note::

        If the ``command`` requires additional arguments,
        wrap it via :py:func:`~functools.partial`, for example
        ``AsyncBulkCall(partial(async_rm, force=True), ...)``.
